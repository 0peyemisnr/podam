Introduction

  Podam is a tool to help developers with their unit tests by auto-filling Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) 
  with dummy data.

* How to use the API in version 1.0.0

  <<Please note that the API has changed starting from version 2.0.0>>. 
  If you are using version 1.0.0 the use of PodamFactory looks like this (version 1.0.0): 
  
+-----------------------------------
Pojo myPojo = PodamFactory.manufacturePojo(Pojo.class); //It uses the default data provider strategy
+-----------------------------------

  Or, if you are using your own DataProviderStrategy (version 1.0.0)

+-----------------------------------
DataProviderStrategy strategy = new MyDataProviderStrategy();
Pojo myPojo = PodamFactory.manufacturePojo(Pojo.class, strategy);
+-----------------------------------

* How to use the API starting from version 2.0.0

  Starting from version 2.0.0 the PodamFactory has been made an instantiable class so that it can be easily used as a Spring
  bean.    
  
+-----------------------------------
PodamFactory factory = new PodamFactoryImpl(); //This will use the default Random Data Provider Strategy
Pojo myPojo = factory.manufacturePojo(Pojo.class);

+-----------------------------------

  Alternatively, if you want to define your own Strategy to assign values (see below), you can use the following version: 
  
+-----------------------------------

DataProviderStrategy strategy = new MyDataProviderStrategy();
PodamFactory factory = new PodamFactoryImpl(strategy);

Pojo myPojo = factory.manufacturePojo(Pojo.class, strategy);

+-----------------------------------

  Please note that the data provider strategy cannot be changed upon instantiation. If you want to use a different data provider
  strategy, you'll need to create a new instance of PodamFactory. This has been decided to preserve thread-safety and immutability
  of PodamFactory.  
  
* How PODAM assigns values
  
  By default PODAM assigns random values to all its types. However, PODAM can be extended by providing a custom implementation
  of the <uk.co.jemos.podam.api.DataProviderStrategy> interface. 
  Please note that methods which return a numeric value between ranges should consider the ranges inclusive, as documented
  in the interface Javadoc. 
  
  PODAM uses the <uk.co.jemos.podam.api.RandomDataProviderStrategy> class as default Data Provider implementation.   
  
  
  To know more about how PODAM works, please refer to the {{{./walk-through-example.html} The walk-through example}} page 
  or to the {{{./corner-cases.html} Corner Cases }} page on the left menu.
  
Using PODAM

  Using PODAM is easy. You can either {{{./downloads.html} download the source}} and build it yourself or you declare PODAM
  as a Maven dependency.
  
* Building PODAM from the source

  The following pre-requisites must be satisfied in order to build PODAM: 
  
  * The <mvn> command must be available from the command line
  
  * Java 5 or later version must be available
  
  * You must have access to Maven central repository (at the time of writing {{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/}}) and you must
  be able to download artifacts from the internet. The {{{./dependencies.html} dependencies}} page on the left menu shows 
  the dependencies PODAM relies on. At the time of writing these are very simple: 
  
    * JUnit
    
    * Log4j
    
    * jcip (a library of annotations to document thread-safety)
  
  Once the pre-requisites have been satisfied, extract the source jar to a folder of your choice. 
  Then, to build PODAM simply execute the following command:
  
+-----------------------------------------

# To build PODAM jar and execute the tests
mvn clean install   

# To build this documentation
mvn clean site:site

# To build javadocs
mvn clean javadoc:jar

+-----------------------------------------

* Declaring PODAM as a Maven dependency 

  * Snapshot versions are available from {{{https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/} Nexus OSS snapshot repository}}. 
  
  * Releases and Release Candidates versions are available from {{{http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/uk/co/jemos/podam/podam/} Maven Central}}.

  To use Podam from within your Maven project, declare the following dependency:
  
+-------------------------------------------
<dependency>
  <groupId>uk.co.jemos.podam</groupId>
  <artifactId>podam</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
  <!-- <scope>test</scope> -->
</dependency>
